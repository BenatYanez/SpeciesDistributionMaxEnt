## Goals for this practical

* #### Obtain species occurence data for *Gypaetus barbatus* and *Antilocapra americana* from GBIF
* #### Obtain current and future climate data from WorldClim to use as species distribution predictors
* #### Use a MaxEnt approach for pressence only data by creating background data and matching occurrence to climate data and see how good the model is
* ###Carry out predictions of future ranges based on future climate data
